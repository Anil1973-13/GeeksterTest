        <h4 style="text-align:center">A Short Biography of Lata Mangeshkar</h4>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lata Mangeshkar was born in Indore on September 28, 1929, and became, quite simply, the most popular
                playback singer in Bollywood's history.</li>

            <li>Her father started teaching her music at an early age. By the time she was five, Lata was seen
                participating as an actress in plays written by her father.</li>
            <li>She sung for over 50 years for actresses from Nargis to Preity Zinta, as well as recorded albums of all
                kinds (ghazals, pop, etc).</li>
            <li>She is one of the only two singers and the only playback singer to have been awarded the Bharat Ratna,
                the country’s highest civilian honour the other being the classical vocalist M.S Subbulakshmi.</li>
            <li>She has also been awarded Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan and Dada Saheb Phalke Award in recognition of
                her great achievement in the field of music. Moreover she has received four Filmfare Awards, the
                Platinum Disc of EMI London and numerous other awards.</li>
            <li>The story moves further as Lata continues to rock the nation with her melodious and harmonious voice.
                She has become an ideal for all the aspiring young girls who want to pursue the profession of singing.
                Her simplicity and humility is as amazing as her voice.</li>
            <li>Ghulam Haider had once said years ago, “Let me foretell today, that this girl will put to shame everyone
                else including Noor Jahan. Producers and directors will fall at her feet, begging her to sing in their
                film”. Well, there is no doubt about the prophecy coming true.</li>
            <li>Till date, India has failed to produce another Lata Mangeshkar and it seems that there can be no other
                like her even in the years to come.</li>
